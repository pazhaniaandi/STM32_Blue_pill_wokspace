**Description**
This repository is dedicated to my learning journey with the STM32 Blue Pill microcontroller. As someone new to both GitHub and STM32 development, the code and branches in this project may initially appear unorganized. However, I am committed to steadily improving the quality of my code and project structure over time.

This space marks the beginning of my exploration into embedded systems, and I hope it serves as a foundation for continuous growth, learning, and hands-on experien
